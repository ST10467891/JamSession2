## Key Elements of The App
Android Studio and Kotlin were used to create my app called Jam Session2. The main purpose of Jam Session2 is to engage the user in a fun environment where playlists are made based on the persons favourite artists or genres. The app prompts the user to enter their artists song title , artist's name , a rating from 1 -5 given to the chosen song and allowing the user to give commentary.

## GitHub Actions
I used GitHub to track and manage all code changes efficiently, additionally , GitHub Actions streamlined the build and deployment process. Lastly, emphasizing the value of version and automation in software development.

## Challenges 
- I came across challenges when dealing with the placement of code. Using the appropriate structure and syntax for the desired outcome.
- Faced challenges when starting up the emulator on bluestacks. It led to a delay in my code running on multiple occassions.
